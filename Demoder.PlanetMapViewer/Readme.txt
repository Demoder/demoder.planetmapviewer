   You may also shrink or enlarge the planet map using the Magnification control in the main UI, or holding ctrl while using the mouse scroll wheel.
   In addition, you may:
      Double left-click: Center camera to location and zoom in one layer. (Or press + (plus))
      Double right-click: Center camera to location and zoom out one layer. (Or press - (minus))

   Fullscreen mode:

   Overlay mode:
      The right-hand menu is hidden
      Screen space taken by window borders are reduced
      Window will remain on top of other windows
      An extensive menu becomes available upon right-click of the title bar
      You may optionally disable scrollbars in this mode
