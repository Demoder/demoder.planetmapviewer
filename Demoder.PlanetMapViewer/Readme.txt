	If you are installing for the first time:
		No special notes.

Map interactions
	You may pan the map by clicking and holding the left mouse button on the map, and moving your mouse around.
	Alternatively, you may pan the map by using the scroll wheel. Horizontal scrollwheels are also supported. 
	If you only have vertical scroll, you may press shift while scrolling to pan horizontally.
	In addition, you may:
		Double left-click: Center camera to location and zoom in one layer. (Or press + (plus))
		Double right-click: Center camera to location and zoom out one layer. (Or press - (minus))
		Single middle-click: Center camera to location.

Modes of operation
	Normal mode: No special notes.
	Fullscreen mode:
		The application will be maximized and window borders are removed. Useful when you have a dedicated monitor for the map viewer.
	Overlay mode:
		The right-hand menu is hidden
		Screen space taken by window borders are reduced
		Window will remain on top of other windows
		An extensive menu becomes available upon right-click of the title bar
		You may optionally disable scrollbars in this mode
		This mode allows for a much smaller window size than the other modes. You may still maximize the window to cover a full screen, if you wish.
